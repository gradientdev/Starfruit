    Starfruit texts you a motivational quote at whatever time you choose every day.
    \n\nStarfruit uses your phone\'s built-in messaging app to send quotes, keeping the app completely microtransaction and ad free!
    \n\nIf you are enjoying the app, I would really appreciate a review.
    \n\nAny questions, comments, or feedback? email me at xinyunzhouu@gmail.com!
